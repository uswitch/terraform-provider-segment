# segment_destination_filter (Resource)

A destination filter which allows control of how events are flowing to destinations. More information on destination filters and how they are used can be found in the [Segment Destination Filters documentation](https://segment.com/docs/connections/destinations/destination-filters/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Filter to drop events
resource "segment_destination_filter" "drop_events" {
  destination = "test_destination"
  title       = "Checkout events only"
  description = "Only send checkout events to destination"
  condition   = "event != \"Checkout\"" # Invert condition to drop all events but `Checkout`
  enabled     = true
  actions {
    drop {}
  }
}

#Â Filter to sample data

# Filter to blacklist fields

# Filter to whitelist fields
```
