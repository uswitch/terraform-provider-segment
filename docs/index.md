# Segment Provider

The Segment provider provides resources to interact with a Segment Config API.

It is recommended to use an authentication token with access to only the resources which are managed
via the provider.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "segment" {
  access_token = "test_access_token"       # or via SEGMENT_ACCESS_TOKEN env var.
  workspace    = "test_workspace"          # or via SEGMENT_WORKSPACE env var.
  unsupported_destination_config_props = [ # Optional
    "appboy/datacenter"
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- **access_token** (String) A Segment Config API token, more details about it can be found the [Config API documentation](https://segment.com/docs/config-api/authentication/).
- **workspace** (String) The Segment workspace slug.

### Optional

- **unsupported_destination_config_props** (Set of String) An array of destination configuration properties which are not supported by the Segment Config API and will result in an error when applying the plan.
Properties defined here get removed from the destination configuration before calling the API. These properties will need to be defined through the UI instead.Configuration properties of type `select` are the ones resulting in an error.
